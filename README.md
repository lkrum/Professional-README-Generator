## Description
As someone who has spent 8+ years in writing and editing fields, I can tell you that writing isn't always easy. I've created a README generator that developers can use to create professional-looking READMEs for their applications. The generated README includes sections for a table of contents, a description, installation instructions, usage instructions, license information, contribution guidelines, test instructions, and questions for how to contact the user.

Link to video demo:

## Installation
1. Copy the SSH key in my GitHub repo and paste `git clone <SSHKEY>` in your terminal to create a local copy on your computer\
OR
2. Download the zip file and manually copy the files to your computer
3. Install node by copying and pasting the code `npm init -y` in your terminal
4. Install the inquirer package by copying and pasting the code `npm i inquirer@8.2.4` in your terminal

## Usage
1. Open the index.js file in your terminal
2. Make sure you have the starter code installed
3. Run `node index.js` to start the application 
4. Answer the questions and use the generated README in your next project
